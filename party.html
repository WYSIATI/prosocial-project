        <strong>Kick off your night with a big glass water so you begin the night hydrated.</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It’s a good idea to drink plenty of water, especially while you are partying. You can do this by alternating your favourite beverage with water - this way
you won’t get too dehydrated. That also means you won’t be as hung over the next day…that means no morning headache and you will make it to class like a    <strong class = "goldcolor">PRO</strong>!
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li class = "header1">
        <strong>Eat before you drink so your body can soak up the alcohol.</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Foods like bread, cheese, potatoes and pasta work great (and are also delicious) - they line your stomach so you won’t end your night hugging the toilet
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li  class = "header1">
        <strong>Set limits. </strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This way you party like a <strong class = "goldcolor">PRO</strong> without missing out on the fun. Each person’s limit may be different, but the average person shouldn’t drink
    more than 2 drinks in an hour to maintain your buzz. You may be approaching your limit if you are:
</p>
<p>
    - Stumbling or staggering
</p>
<p>
    - Blurry vision or blood shot eyes
</p>
<p>
    - Slurred speech
</p>
<p>
    - Poor hand-eye coordination
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li  class = "header1">
        <strong>Put lots of ice in your drink.</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Not only will help you take smaller sips, but will also keep your drink nice and cold. Now you’re drinking like a <strong class = "goldcolor">PRO!</strong>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li  class = "header1">
        <strong>Pace yourself.</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Drinking too much, too fast is dangerous. It also leads to being sloppy drunk…which nobody likes! If you can pace your drinking, and know when enough is
    enough, you can avoid doing things that you will regret later (like showing off those not so great dance moves) and will also help you avoid an epic
    hangover the next day.
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li  class = "header1">
        <strong>Avoid mixing drugs and alcohol. </strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It can have unpredictable effects, and can be seriously risky, especially if you mix alcohol with drugs like antidepressants or sleeping pills. Actually
even over the counter drugs (i.e., allergy meds) can have negative effects when mixed with alcohol. But    <strong><em>this doesn’t mean that you should skip your medication</em> </strong>if you are planning to drink, as that can have harmful effects as well.
    Instead, check with your health care provider or pharmacist about the effects of combining your medication with alcohol to make sure you stay safe and
    healthy like a <strong class = "goldcolor">PRO</strong>!
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li class = "header1">
        <strong>PRO’s</strong>
        <strong> know when to party. </strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Make sure you balance your social life with your responsibilities, like showing up to class and work. Choose times to drink when you don’t have other
    commitments. When party time is over don’t forget to take a break from boozing – set aside alcohol-free periods to help your body recover

<p>
    Taking care of yourself is important, but <strong class = "goldcolor">PRO’s</strong> also watch out for their friends. Here are some tips to keep your friends safe on a night
    out:
</p>
<ul  class = "header1">
    <li>
        <strong>Start together - end together.</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you start the night together, make sure you keep checking in and that everybody makes it home safely. When you know where your friends are and who they
    are with, you can make sure they are partying like a <strong class = "goldcolor">PRO</strong> and getting home safe at the end of the night.
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li  class = "header1">
        <strong>Help your friends stick to safe limits.</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Don’t encourage your friends to drink more than they want to, or to the point where they get sloppy. Set limits ahead of time and help your friends stick
    to a good pace. Hey, you would want them to do the same for you!
</p>
<p>
    Here are some<strong> signs</strong> that your friend might drinking too much and some <strong>tips</strong> about how to help them:

        <strong>If your friend drinks too much take care of them.</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Sometimes being a good friend means ending your night early to walk your friend home and tuck them in. Just be careful they aren’t too drunk and in the
    danger zone for alcohol poisoning.

<ul type="disc">

<p>
    Know the <strong class = "goldcolor"><em>signs of alcohol poisoning</em></strong> so you can help them like a <strong class = "goldcolor">PRO </strong>
</p>


<p class = "header1">
    <strong>What is alcohol poisoning?</strong>
</p>

<p>
     When someone has alcohol poisoning their blood alcohol level has gotten so high that it is toxic (poisonous) to the body.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Alcohol poisoning can sometimes be difficult to spot.</strong>
        It can be a very fine line. One minute your friend is stupidly drunk, the next they’ve become dangerously intoxicated. They may have only had a few
        drinks, or they could have downed several, but how much they drink isn’t always an indicator. There is no minimum amount. It depends on your age, sex,
        size, weight, how fast you’ve been drinking, how much you’ve eaten, your general health and other drugs you might have taken. Your body can only
        process one unit of alcohol an hour.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>
        By recognising the signs of acute alcohol poisoning and knowing what to do, you could save someone’s life. Read more below so that you can help PROtect
        your friends.
